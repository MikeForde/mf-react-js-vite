Note code has been modified very slightly:
 - files postfixed <b>.jsx</b> instead of just <b>.js</b> (needed by Glitch)
 - import React statement retained (currently needed by Glitch)
 - <b>const ComponentName = () =></b> replaced with <b>function ComponentName()</b> (not a Glitch requirement but Glitches default and easier to write!)
 - export default combined with component declaration (purely optional)
 
Other minor issues:
- You'll need to add PropTypes package as not present by default
